Hybrid Cyber Physical Security Framework for autonomous Maritime Vessel

In the expanses of the worldâ€™s oceans, a new chapter in maritime exploration and transportation is taking shape, driven by advancements in autonomous technologies. From surface vessels to remotely operated underwater vehicles, autonomous maritime systems offer increased efficiency, safety and reliability in sea operations. However, as these transformative technologies emerge a significant challenge arises, the need to protect these vessels from evolving cyber threats and vulnerabilities. 
In the realm, where the intersection of digital and physical realms is ever present traditional cybersecurity methods fall short in addressing the intricate relationship between digital networks and physical infrastructure. With autonomous vessels becoming more interconnected and reliant on systems for navigation, communication and control purposes they become exposed to various cyber threats ranging from unauthorized access to advanced cyber physical attacks. 
To meet this demand for comprehensive security solutions tailored to the specific demands of autonomous maritime vessels our research aims to introduce an innovative approach, the creation of a Hybrid Cyber Physical Security Framework. This pioneering framework signifies a shift in security practices by combining sophisticated cybersecurity measures with robust physical security components to offer complete protection, against cyber threats, physical interference and hybrid attacks.
